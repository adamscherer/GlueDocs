## Glue Docs (maybe not the final name)

Glue Docs is website containing sample apps and mini-projects demonstrating how various 
SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), or traditional 
frameworks can be combined "glued" together to create a solution to a 
problem.

This concept evolved over the past 5 - 8 years and is a divergence from where
I initially began my career in 1999.  When I first started, the biggest question
to answer was - Which programming language should be use?  Since then, it's
not about the programming language and more about which group of services do
I need which should ultimately make life easier but can often make things
more complicated.  The samples found in the repository attempt to help show
examples that can be used within your project.
